<h2>SAYERS CROFT</h2>  
<P> Sayers Croft is an amazing place
to go for birthday parties or even school
residential! It has 20 rooms  and over
40 activities.
It is eco freindly and It is home
to a lot of history! It
Sayers Croft was an evacuation for
Catford Boys Central School.The boys
were safe because Sayers Croft is in the contry-side
and only one bomb hit them because one of the nazis
had a spare bomb so they droped it on the country-side.
 Luckily because of the shelters no one was killed
 just getting away with a few injuries on the way.
