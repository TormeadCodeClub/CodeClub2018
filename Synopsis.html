      <h2> Porridge is all about a bunch of friendly, fairy tale folk.</h2>
      <h2> But in the centre of tht folk is a bunch of folk more rotten than a rancid bowl of curds and whey who are plaguing Happy Valley with crimes.</h2>
      <h2> It is Jack Spratt (Private Investigator/Detective) and his new sidekick, Lucy Locket's task to find out who are plaguing Happy Valley's folk with crimes beyond the roof.</h2>
      <h2> Oh, and the local cops help. Poor Seargent and Chief. they have a sightly dim crew.</h2>
      <h2> Join us in our play! There will be lots and lots of laughs!</h2>
